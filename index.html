		The visualization shows the popularity of each character on any given episode of Game of Thrones based on Twitter tweets.  The visualization also feature, under each name, the most popular emojis used with the character in the tweets.  The characters mentioned together in a tweet are shown by a line.  This visualization is interactive.  The user can interact with it by changing the episode shown.  This can be done by selecting the desired episode from the drop-down menu, or by using the previous and forward navigation buttons.  The user can also hover over a character to reveal more information such as, their popularity over the course of the entire show, their percentage of popularity in the episode,  and their connections to other characters.  Users can also interact with a sliding bar to filter which characters are shown, by setting a minimum percentage of mentions in characters or connections.  The design choice was to represent the data in a cluster-like web.  The design provides more information about the data by having sub-clusters that are encapsulated in their own opaque shapes.  The visualization also uses varying sizes of data points to represent the frequency a character is mentioned, the larger their data point, the higher their mentions.  The colors used for the data points are all dark and solid so they stand out more.  The interaction techniques are used in a way in which the user can gain more information about each data point if they choose.  I think the rationale behind the design choice of using a cluster-like web is likely because a bar graph, or another more conventional design, would not be as effective in seeing the relationships between each character.  This cluster allows data points to be next to each other, which makes it easier to picture which group of characters are mentioned together as well as the plotlines that may be occurring.  The colors of the data points correlate to each character’s affiliation so having many distinct colors allows the user to easily distinguish who is who.  The interaction techniques are used so the user is not overloaded with too much information at once, and it also makes the design much cleaner as there is less to display.

		I think this is a good visualization because it easily conveys the data it intended to represent in an effective manner.  It allows the user to easily determine which characters had big moments in each episode based on the size of their data point.  In addition to this, it supplies connections between characters which also allow the user to infer plotlines.  The added information of the top emojis used with any given character provides even more information in regards to the plot as well as the reception it had with the audience.  The main critique I have is the legend is inconsistent.  Most the legend refers to a location, such as King’s Landing, North, and Dorne.  The legend then also has house names, such as Targaryen and Lannister, and groups of people, such as Wildings and Dothraki.  This is problematic because there are characters who lie in between multiple categories in the legend.  In order to mend this, I would change the legend to be exclusively by location or house affiliation and not one or the other.  Another potential flaw is Game of Thrones character names are rather difficult to spell and this may effect the data collected.
